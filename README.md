# Yolo

This script is based on the Yolo series. Since it is quite complicated for beginers to understand the layers output and structure of the network, this script is written as a package for beginers or developers that are in rush to test their model.

The weight file in the Demo file is downloaded from https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ 

Try it out and have fun
